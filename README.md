This python script runs in QGIS and takes a geotiff and splits it up into .pngs

Then it instructs you to give the .pngs to whatever AI upscaler you use (e.g bigjpg.com) before putting the upscaled versions into another folder

Then it grabs the upscaled versions and puts them all together into a final geotiff

I find this handy for upscaling Sentinel imagery from 10m to 2.5m pixels, so that it is a bit nicer to look at
